#üõ†Ô∏è QuickFix API

üìÑ Project Overview
QuickFix is a RESTful API connecting customers with service providers for home services like plumbing, woodwork, and electrical tasks. Customers post jobs with details such as category, description, location, budget, and preferred date/time. Providers, after admin approval, can accept and manage jobs through statuses like Pending, Accepted, In Progress, Completed, and Rejected. Admins manage users, jobs, and provider requests through a dashboard.
The system features JWT authentication, role-based access (CUSTOMER, PROVIDER, SUPER_ADMIN), in-app and email notifications, profile management with image uploads, pagination, filtering, and search.
